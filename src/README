soundKonverter has nothing to do with the soundconverter project, the very similar name is just an unfortunate coincident.

Installation:
=============
This section describes install soundKonverter from it's sources.
If you prefer to use precompiled packages have a look at the corresponding section below.

First you should make sure that all dependences are installed.
soundKonverter will need the follwing packages to compile:
kde development packages version 4.4 or higher
taglib development packages version 1.4 or higher
cdparanoia development packages
All dependences - and whether they are fulfilled - should be shown when running cmake.

Then open a console and change to the soundKonverter source directory and execute the following commands:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde-config --prefix` ..
make
sudo make install

For installing soundKonverter to your home directory see Building Amarok Locally at: http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/2.0_Development_HowTo



Un-Installation:
================
For uninstalling soundKonverter, open a console and change to the soundKonverter build directory.
(If you followed the instructions above it's the directory named 'build' in the soundKonverter source directory.)
Then execute one of the following commands:

sudo xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
or
make uninstall

In order to remove the soundKonverter configuration and kde integration, run the following commands:

rm ~/.kde4/share/config/soundkonverterrc
rm -r ~/.kde4/share/apps/soundkonverter
rm ~/.kde4/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/add_replaygain_with_soundkonverter.desktop
rm ~/.kde4/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/convert_with_soundkonverter.desktop

or (depending on the location of your local kde directory)

rm ~/.kde/share/config/soundkonverterrc
rm -r ~/.kde/share/apps/soundkonverter
rm ~/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/add_replaygain_with_soundkonverter.desktop
rm ~/.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/convert_with_soundkonverter.desktop



Precompiled packages:
=====================
openSUSE users should either add the following installation source to yast: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/HessiJames/<suse version>
eg.: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/HessiJames/openSUSE_11.3 for openSUSE 11.3.
Or add the KDE:Extra repository.
eg.: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Extra/openSUSE_11.4 for openSUSE 11.4
More information about openSUSE KDE repositories: http://en.opensuse.org/KDE_repositories

Ubuntu/Debain Packages are also available at http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/HessiJames
Packages for non openSUSE distributions are not tested, so please tell me if something is wrong with the packages.

Here is another download interface with some instructions (please check if the version number is up-to-date):
http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:HessiJames&package=soundkonverter-1.1.0

If your distribution is not listed here, you should start an internet search, there might be precompiled packages for your distribution provided by somebody else.
(But make sure the source is trustworthy of cause...)
